── WHAT THIS CANDIDATE IS SEEKING ──
Roles: ${seeking}
Location: ${candidate.location_pref}
Track: ${candidate.ic_or_lead} | Stage pref: ${candidate.stage_pref}

── WHAT THEY BRING ──
Current title: ${candidate.title} (${candidate.seniority}, ${candidate.years_exp} yrs)
Skills: ${candidate.skills}
Competitive edges: ${candidate.candidate_edges}

── TWO-STEP SCORING ──

STEP 1 — INTENT MATCH (non-negotiable gate):
Does the job title/function match what the candidate is SEEKING?
If NO → score ≤ 10. Stop here.
Do NOT use past experience keywords (tools, industries, companies) to find "related" roles.
The candidate stated what they want — only match that.

Examples:
  Seeking "Marketing Manager" + job "Account Executive" → ≤ 10 (Sales ≠ Marketing)
  Seeking "Marketing Manager" + job "Engagement Manager" (consulting) → ≤ 10 (Management consulting ≠ Marketing)
  Seeking "Marketing Manager" + job "Growth Marketing Lead" → proceed to Step 2
  Seeking "Product Manager" + job "Software Engineer" → ≤ 10 (Engineering ≠ Product)
  Seeking "Product Manager" + job "Senior PM" → proceed to Step 2

STEP 2 — FIT QUALITY (only for jobs that pass Step 1):
How well does the candidate's background set them up for THIS specific role?
  - Seniority match (years exp vs. role level)
  - Skills overlap with role requirements
  - Location / remote match
  - Company stage alignment
Score 40–100 based on how competitive they'd be.
